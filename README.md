# Pairwise-Indepence-Autoencoder: learning disentangled representation with pairwise independence

## [ [Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09251) 
The implementation of PIAE. 
In this work we introduce the method to learn disentangled representation unsupervisedly with the assumption that the latent codes are pairwise independent. We also give our implementation of other learning methods..

## Prerequisites
